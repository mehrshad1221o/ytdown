## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio (latest stable version recommended).
    *   Click on `File > Open` and select the cloned repository folder.
    *   Android Studio will automatically sync the project and download the necessary dependencies.
3.  **Python Setup:**
    *   The project uses [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) to run Python. You may need a local Python installation (version 3.8+ recommended) for the Gradle plugin to use during the build process. Ensure it's available in your system's PATH.
4.  **Run the app:**
    *   Connect an Android device (Android 8.0+) or start an emulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in Android Studio.

## üöÄ Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build the application.

*   On every push to the `main` branch, a new Debug APK is built.
*   You can find the latest compiled APK in the "Artifacts" section of the latest workflow run on the [Actions tab](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/actions).
*   The workflow also creates a new GitHub Release tagged `build-<run_number>` with the APK attached.

### Release Signing

To create a signed Release APK, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

*   `RELEASE_KEYSTORE`: The base64-encoded content of your Java Keystore file.
    *   To generate this, run: `base64 -w 0 my-release-key.keystore > release.keystore.base64` and copy the contents.
*   `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`: The alias for your key.
*   `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`: The password for your key.
*   `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password for the keystore.
